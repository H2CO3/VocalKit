VocalKit
--------
(Original author: Brian King)


VocalKit is an Objective-C wrapper around the pocketsphinx speech recognition library,
along with an extensive American English language model to provide speech recognition
features for iOS devices. This works not only on the iPhone 4S, but on all devices.

How to use:
-----------

	#import <VocalKit/VocalKit.h>
	
	@interface MyDelegate: NSObject <VKManagerDelegate> {
		VKManager *manager;
	}
	
	@end
	
	
	@implementation MyDelegate
	
	- (id) init
	{
		if ((self = [super init]))
		{
			manager = [[VKManager alloc] init];
			manager.delegate = self;
		}
		
		return self;
	}
	
	// ...
	// To start recording speech to be recognized:
	// [manager startListening];
	// ...
	
	// ...
	// To stop recording and start processing/recognizing the text:
	// [manager stopListening];
	// ...
	
	- (void) vkManager:(VKManager *)mgr recognizedText:(NSString *)text
	{
		// Do whatever you want with "text"
	}


Notices:
--------

1. This is HUGE. The complete framework weighs about 20MB (God bless we haven't more
often-used words in English!)
2. Still in development. That is, not very precise, but it mostly works fine.
3. Text-to-speech has been cut out from the original lib, as it can be implemented
   using free online services (http://github.com/H2CO3/BingTranslate), and the text
   to speech part is already 6MB. Way too large.
